## Overview

The Orgo API lets you manage virtual computer environments programmatically. Use our API to create, manage, and control projects in your Orgo account.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

You can obtain your API key from the [Orgo projects dashboard](https://www.orgo.ai/projects).

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://www.orgo.ai/api
```

## Response Format

Responses are returned in JSON format. A successful response will include the requested data, while an error response will include an `error` field with details about what went wrong.

## Project Limits

Each account is limited to 3 active projects by default. Contact support to request an increase to this limit.
